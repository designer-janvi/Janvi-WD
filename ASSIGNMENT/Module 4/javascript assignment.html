                                         JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language.
                                          Itis lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whoseimplementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. 
                                          It is aninterpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.

                                         The isNaN() function is used to check whether a given value is an illegal number or not. It returns 
                                         true if value is a NaN else returns false. It is different from the Number.isNaN() Method.

                                         NEGATIVE_INFINITY is the same as the negative value of the global object's Infinity property. This 
                                         value behaves slightly differently than mathematical infinity: Any positive value, including 
                                         POSITIVE_INFINITY , multiplied by NEGATIVE_INFINITY is NEGATIVE_INFINITY .

                                         Undefined variable means a variable has been declared but it does not have a value. Undeclared 
                                         variable means that the variable does not exist in the program at all.

                                          The strict equality operator (===) checks whether its two operands are equal, returning a Boolean result.
                                         Unlike the equality operator, the strict equality operator always considers operands of different types to be different.

                                         The class name is used as a selector in HTML which helps to give some value to the element attributes.
                                        The document. getElementById() method is used to return the element in the document 
                                         with the “id” attribute and the “className” attribute can be used to change/append the class of the element.

                                            In JavaScript Extensions, you can use 
                                            fh = fopen(getScriptPath(), 0); to open a file 
                                            Using ActiveX objects, following should be included in your code to read a file:

                                         The delete operator removes a given property from an object. On successful deletion, it will return 
                                        true , else false will be returned. However, it is important to consider the following scenarios: If the 
                                        property which you are trying to delete does not exist, delete will not have any effect and will return true .

                                         Approach: We can use window. location property inside the script tag to forcefully load another 
                                         page in Javascript. It is a reference to a Location object that is it represents the current location of

                                         There is no append support without reparsing the whole innerHTML. This makes changing 
                                         innerHTML directly very slow. innerHTML does not provide validation and therefore we can 
                                         potentially insert valid and broken HTML in the document and break it.
